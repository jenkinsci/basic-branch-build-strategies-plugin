== Version 1.3.1 (2019-04-16)

* Fixed incorrect layering between API and SPI calls - only the API is allowed to call the SPI directly and the SPI in link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/basic-branch-build-strategies-plugin/pull/3[PR-3] was breaking that contract and calling the delegate SPIs directly rather than acting as an API consumer, resulting in link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-56984[JENKINS-56984]

== Version 1.3.0 (2019-04-05)
